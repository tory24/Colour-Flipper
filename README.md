# Colour-Flipper


### What is it?

A quick project I wanted to do that changes web page background colour matching the colour to the displayed RGB or HEX value on page.

#### Why did I make this?

Basically to just prove to myself that I have learnt enough to build a very basic website, that implements CSS, HTML & JS all in one.
