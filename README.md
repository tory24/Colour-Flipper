# Colour-Flipper

A quick project I wanted to do that changes web page background colour matching the colour to the displayed RGB or HEX value on page.

#### Why

Just wanted to apply some of what I have learnt to build a very basic page that implements CSS, HTML & JS.

##### Edit:
* Added a new folder that works from a single HTML page.
* It also converts Hex to RGB and vice versa, rather than start fresh when you change through the navbar.
