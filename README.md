# Colour-Flipper


### What is it?

A quick project I wanted to do that changes web page background colour matching the colour to the displayed RGB or HEX value on page.

#### Why did I make this?

Basically just to prove to myself that I can apply some of what I have learnt to build a very basic page that implements CSS, HTML & JS.
